# Implementation Progress

> Last Updated: May 4, 2025 (Today)

This document tracks progress on adapting the CursorRules Architect for VSCode and GitHub Copilot using Azure OpenAI exclusively.

## 1. Core Changes Progress

### Replace `.cursorrules` with VSCode-compatible Format
- [x] Update GitHub Copilot configuration in `.vscode` directory
- [x] Update documentation to reference GitHub Copilot instead of CursorRules

### Update API Integration
- [x] Add Azure OpenAI SDK integration (core/agents/azure_openai.py)
- [x] Remove integration code for Anthropic, OpenAI (non-Azure), DeepSeek, and Google Gemini
  - [x] Removed core/agents/gemini.py implementation
  - [x] Updated ReasoningMode in core/agents/base.py to remove non-Azure specific comments
  - [x] Updated test_env.py to remove checks for non-Azure provider API keys
  - [x] Updated factory.py to ensure explicit error for non-Azure providers
  - [x] Updated main.py imports and client initializations to remove non-Azure providers
  - [x] Updated HTTPRequestFilter to only track Azure OpenAI requests
- [x] Update model references to Azure AI available models (e.g., gpt-4o)

### Configuration Updates
- [x] Replace Cursor-specific environment variables with Azure AI equivalents
- [x] Update installation instructions for VSCode and GitHub Copilot

## 2. Detailed Implementation Progress

### Step 1: VSCode Configuration ✅

- [x] Updated `.vscode/settings.json` with GitHub Copilot settings
- [x] Created `.vscode/extensions.json` with recommended extensions
- [x] Created `.vscode/launch.json` for debugging configuration
- [x] Created `.vscode/tasks.json` for common project tasks

### Step 2: Azure OpenAI Integration ✅

- [x] Created `core/agents/azure_openai.py` with Azure OpenAI implementation
- [x] Updated `core/agents/base.py` to include Azure OpenAI provider
- [x] Updated `core/agents/factory.py` to use Azure OpenAI architect
- [x] Added Azure OpenAI model configurations to `core/types/models.py`
- [x] Updated `config/agents.py` to use Azure OpenAI models
- [x] Updated `requirements.txt` with Azure OpenAI dependencies
- [x] Created `.env.example` for environment variable setup

### Step 3: Update Requirements.txt ✅

- [x] Added Azure OpenAI SDK dependencies
- [x] Updated version constraints for security
- [x] Removed unnecessary dependencies

### Step 4: Update Documentation ⏳

- [ ] Update README.md to reflect the Azure OpenAI integration
- [ ] Update CONTRIBUTING.md with new Azure OpenAI configuration instructions
- [ ] Create migration guide for users moving from Cursor to VSCode

### Step 5: Azure OpenAI Integration Module ✅

- [x] Created base Azure OpenAI architect implementation
- [x] Implemented proper error handling for API calls
- [x] Added proper authentication handling

## 3. Security and Dependency Implementation

- [x] Implement secure file access controls
- [x] Disable debug mode in non-development environments 
- [ ] Set up HTTPS/TLS support for any web components
- [x] Create version-locked `requirements.txt` file with Azure dependencies
- [x] Implement error handling for Azure OpenAI API calls
- [x] Configure secure storage of API keys via environment variables

## 4. Azure OpenAI Client Implementation ✅

- [x] Implement main Azure OpenAI client
- [x] Update agent factory to use Azure OpenAI
- [x] Implement streaming support
- [x] Update configuration handling

## 5. Next Steps

- [x] Clean up unused agent implementations (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google Gemini)
- [ ] Update the VSCode extension recommendations
  - [ ] Create or update .vscode/extensions.json with GitHub Copilot recommendations
  - [ ] Verify extension compatibility with the updated architecture
- [ ] Test integration with Azure OpenAI
  - [ ] Run the existing Azure OpenAI tests
  - [ ] Update tests to ensure proper Azure OpenAI calls and responses
  - [ ] Verify the system works end-to-end with Azure OpenAI
- [ ] Complete documentation updates
  - [ ] Update README.md to reflect Azure OpenAI integration
  - [ ] Update CONTRIBUTING.md with clearer Azure OpenAI setup instructions
  - [ ] Create migration guide for users moving from Cursor to VSCode
- [ ] Update legacy file handling
  - [ ] Modify the file_retriever.py to work with VSCode instead of Cursor
  - [ ] Remove or adapt remaining cursor-specific files and references
  - [ ] Update the project structure with VSCode conventions
- [ ] Final integration and testing
  - [ ] Rename relevant scripts to reflect VSCode/GitHub Copilot focus
  - [ ] Comprehensive testing across all phases
  - [ ] Security review to ensure proper API key handling

## 6. Testing Progress

- [x] Setup environment variables for Azure OpenAI testing
- [x] Create basic connectivity tests
- [ ] Test each architecture analysis phase
- [ ] Verify correct output formats
- [ ] Add test coverage for error conditions

## 7. Issues and Blockers

None currently.
